zkPET enables privacy-preserving and smart peer-to-peer energy trading via ZKML.

We simplify a set of simple linear models for long-term time series forcasting called [LTSF-Linear](https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear), which were evaluated to surprisingly outperform existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models. The simplified models are trained against the electricity dataset for a demand forcasting task. These trained models are then ZK-ed to generate a proof off-chain and verify on-chain. Performance evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving peer-to-peer energy trading solution based on zero-knowledge machine learning.
